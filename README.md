# MORSENET-The-Encrypted-and-Wireless-Morse-Messaging-using-Queue-Implementation


üîê A secure, real-time Morse code communication system built on ESP32, using embedded C and Queue concepts for efficient messaging.

---

## üìñ Overview

**MORSENET** revives Morse code for modern use by combining embedded systems, encryption, and queue-based message handling. It enables wireless transmission of Morse-encoded messages between ESP32 boards over Wi-Fi using the UDP protocol. The system encrypts data using AES and decodes it on the receiver side for display on an I2C LCD.

## üß† Key Features (Implemented)

- Morse code input via push button (DOT / DASH).
- Message construction using queue logic (`enqueue`, `dequeue`).
- AES encryption on the transmitter side.
- UDP communication over Wi-Fi between ESP32 modules.
- AES decryption on the receiver side.
- Real-time decoded output on a 16x2 I2C LCD display.

### üì¶ Code Files

- `AES_TRANSMITTER1.ino` ‚Äì Morse code input, AES encryption, and UDP transmission.
- `AES_RECEIVER.ino` ‚Äì UDP reception, AES decryption, LCD display output.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Upload Instructions

1. Open Arduino IDE.
2. Install the required libraries:
   - `AESLib.h`
   - `WiFi.h`
   - `Wire.h`
   - `LiquidCrystal_I2C.h`
3. Configure your **Wi-Fi SSID** and **password** in both files.
4. Upload `AES_TRANSMITTER1.ino` to the transmitter ESP32.
5. Upload `AES_RECEIVER.ino` to the receiver ESP32.
6. Power both boards and observe communication over serial monitor and LCD.
